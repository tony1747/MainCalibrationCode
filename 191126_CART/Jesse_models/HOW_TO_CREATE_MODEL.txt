README_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_MODEL



To create a model for use with the model class, you need to create two files

Pick a name, here represented as NAME.

Create two files:

1) paramInfo_NAME.csv
2) RHS_NAME.m

paramInfo_name.csv


RHS_NAME.m needs to contain a function that returns the vector dx/dt:
 RHS_NAME(t, xx, p)
 t = time
 xx = current state variable vector
 p = parameter vector
